# README
Sellify is a project completed by students in the [Flatiron School](https://flatironschool.com/) June 2016 Web Immersive Course.

##Sellify
Buy and sell within your trusted organizations!

Sellify was built with a ReactJS front-end supported by Redux. The backend is supported with a [Rails Based API](https://github.com/greatermeans/sellify-api). On user login, the front-end sideloads all the data the user may need from the API. The backend stands ready to make any updates necessary, e.g. new listings, profile updates, and joining new organizations. 

We use Fuse library for a fuzzy search. We built our own Authentication system using the encoder/decoder that comes with the JWT gem. We use AWS to host our listing images. We added client-side and server-side validations to our Redux forms. 

##Built with:
* React.js
